# Project: A High-Throughput CRC32 Accelerator for Microwatt

### Empowering Microwatt for the Open Computing Era with Hardware-Accelerated Data Integrity.

---

### Project Summary

This project proposes the design, integration, and benchmarking of a memory-mapped **CRC32 hardware accelerator** for the Microwatt POWER CPU. Implemented within the ChipFoundry OpenFrame template for the SKY130 process, this peripheral will offload the computationally intensive task of Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) calculation. The primary goal is to deliver a robust, reusable, and open-source IP block that provides a significant, quantifiable performance increase over a purely software-based implementation, thereby making the Microwatt platform more powerful for data-centric applications.

### Motivation

In the open computing era, robust and efficient data handling is paramount. CRC calculations are fundamental to ensuring data integrity in countless applications, from networking (Ethernet, Wi-Fi) to storage (SATA) and file formats (ZIP, PNG). Performing these checks in software consumes valuable CPU cycles that could be used for primary application tasks.

By creating a dedicated hardware accelerator, we free the Microwatt core to perform other work, enabling higher data throughput and greater overall system efficiency. This project serves as a practical, high-impact example of hardware/software co-design that directly contributes to Microwatt's capabilities and its readiness for real-world, data-intensive workloads.

### Core Features

*   **Memory-Mapped Interface:** Simple CPU interaction via `DATA_IN`, `STATUS`, and `CRC_OUT` registers.
*   **Standard Algorithm:** Calculates the standard **CRC-32** checksum (IEEE 802.3 polynomial: `0x04C11DB7`).
*   **Efficient Processing:** Ingests data on a byte-by-byte basis, suitable for streaming applications.
*   **Simple CPU Polling:** A "done" flag in the `STATUS` register signals completion of the calculation.
*   **Reset Capability:** Control bits to initialize/reset the CRC logic for a new data stream.

### Alignment with Judging Criteria

This project is designed from the ground up to meet the requirements of the Microwatt Design Challenge.

*   **Design Technical Merit:** The project improves the Microwatt ecosystem by providing a crucial, reusable IP block for a common computational bottleneck. It demonstrates how Microwatt's bus can be extended with custom hardware to accelerate real-world tasks, enhancing its value for networking and storage applications.
*   **Project Documentation & Reproducibility:** The final deliverable will include a comprehensive `README.md` with a register map, usage instructions, and step-by-step guides for synthesis and simulation. This focus on clear documentation ensures that the project can be easily replicated and understood by the community.
*   **Verification Coverage:** The project includes a self-checking Verilog testbench. This testbench will feed the module a known data stream and automatically verify its final CRC output against a pre-computed value, ensuring correctness and robustness.
*   **Code Quality:** The Verilog RTL will be written in a clean, modular, and well-commented style, adhering to industry best practices to facilitate understanding and future reuse.

### Implementation Outline

1.  **Core RTL Design:** Develop a synthesizable Verilog module for the parallel CRC32 calculation logic.
2.  **Bus Interface & Integration:** Wrap the core logic with a memory-mapped slave interface and integrate it into the OpenFrame `user_project_wrapper`.
3.  **Thorough Verification:** Create a self-checking Verilog testbench that compares the hardware's output against a golden reference value generated by a Python script to guarantee correctness.
4.  **Open-Source Flow Synthesis:** Synthesize the design for the **SKY130** process using the recommended **OpenLane** flow. All necessary scripts and configuration files will be provided to ensure full reproducibility.
5.  **Software & Benchmarking:** Develop two C programs:
    *   A pure software implementation of the CRC32 algorithm.
    *   A driver that utilizes the hardware accelerator.
    Both versions will be benchmarked on a sample dataset to generate clear, compelling performance comparison data (e.g., CPU cycles, execution time).
6.  **Final Documentation:** The final `README.md` will be updated with a register map, usage guide, performance graphs, and a link to a short video demonstrating the project's functionality and results.
