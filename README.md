# Proposal: CRC32 Accelerator Peripheral for Microwatt CPU

### Project Summary

This project proposes the design and integration of a memory-mapped **CRC32 hardware accelerator** for the Microwatt POWER CPU. Implemented within the ChipFoundry OpenFrame template, this peripheral will offload the computationally intensive task of Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) calculation from the main processor. The primary goal is to demonstrate a significant, quantifiable performance increase over a purely software-based implementation for data integrity checks.

### Motivation

CRC calculations are fundamental to ensuring data integrity in countless applications, including networking (Ethernet, Wi-Fi), storage protocols (SATA), and common file formats (ZIP, PNG). Performing these calculations in software consumes valuable CPU cycles, especially in data-heavy applications. A dedicated hardware accelerator provides a much faster and more power-efficient solution, freeing the Microwatt core to perform other tasks and enabling higher data throughput for the entire system. This project demonstrates a classic and practical example of hardware/software co-design for a real-world problem.

### Core Features

* **Memory-mapped** registers for simple CPU interaction (`DATA_IN`, `STATUS`, `CRC_OUT`).
* Calculates the standard **CRC-32** checksum (using the IEEE 802.3 polynomial `0x04C11DB7`).
* Processes data efficiently on a **byte-by-byte** basis.
* Provides a **"done" flag** in a status register, designed to be polled by the CPU.
* Control bits to **initialize/reset** the CRC calculation for a new data stream.

### High-Level Block Diagram



The accelerator connects to the Microwatt CPU via the system bus. The CPU writes data bytes to the peripheral and polls a status register to know when the calculation is complete. The core logic consists of a parallel CRC calculation unit and a simple state machine to manage the register interface.

### Implementation Outline

1.  **Design the Core RTL:** Develop a Verilog module for the parallel CRC32 calculation logic (a 32-bit register with combinational XOR feedback).
2.  **Create Bus Interface:** Wrap the core logic with a simple memory-mapped slave interface to connect to the Microwatt bus.
3.  **Develop Testbench:** Create a self-checking Verilog testbench that feeds the module a data stream and compares its final CRC output against a pre-computed value from a reliable source (e.g., a Python script).
4.  **System Integration:** Integrate the completed peripheral into the OpenFrame user project area.
5.  **Software & Benchmarking:** Write two C programs:
    * A pure software version of the CRC32 algorithm.
    * A driver that uses the hardware accelerator.
    Then, benchmark both versions on a sample dataset to generate clear performance comparison data.
6.  **Documentation:** Document the register map, usage, and benchmark results in the project's `README.md`.

### Expected Outcome

A lightweight, high-performance, and reusable Verilog IP block for CRC32 calculation. The final project will serve as a complete, reproducible example of applying hardware acceleration to the Microwatt platform, featuring a compelling demonstration and clear benchmark data that proves its significant value and efficiency over a software-only approach.
